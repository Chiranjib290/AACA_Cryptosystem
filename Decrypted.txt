cellular automata  as with other multi agent system models  usually treat time as discrete and state updates as occurring synchronously  the state of every cell in the model is updated together  before any of the new states influence other cells  in contrast  an asynchronous cellular automaton is able to update individual cells independently  in such a way that the new state of a cell affects the calculation of states in neighbouring cells 

implementations of synchronous updating can be analysed in two phases  the first  interaction  calculates the new state of each cell based on the neighbourhood and the update rule  state values are held in a temporary store  the second phase updates state values by copying the new states to the cells 

in contrast  asynchronous updating does not necessarily separate these two phases  in the simplest case  fully asynchronous updating   changes in state are implemented immediately 

the synchronous approach assumes the presence of a global clock to ensure all cells are updated together  while convenient for preparing computer systems  this might be an unrealistic assumption if the model is intended to represent  for example  a living system where there is no evidence of the presence of such a device 

a general method repeatedly discovered independently  by k  nakamura in the     s  by t  toffoli in the     s  and by c  l  nehaniv in       allows one to emulate exactly the behaviour of a synchronous cellular automaton via an asynchronous one constructed as a simple modification of the synchronous cellular automaton  nehaniv        correctness of this method however has only more recently been rigorously proved  nehaniv         as a consequence  it follows immediately from results on synchronous cellular automata that asynchronous cellular automata are capable of emulating  e g   conway s game of life  of universal computation  and of self replication  e g   as in a von neumann universal constructor   moreover  the general construction and the proof also applies to the more general class of synchronous automata networks  inhomogeneous networks of automata over directed graphs  allowing external inputs   which includes cellular automata as a special case   showing constructively how their behaviour may be asynchronously realized by a corresponding asynchronous automata network 


update schemes
several studies have implemented asynchronous models and found that their behaviour differs from the synchronous ones  bersini and detours        have shown how sensitive conway s game of life is to the updating scheme  any interesting behaviour disappears in the asynchronous case  harvey and bossomaier        pointed out that stochastic updating in random boolean networks results in the expression of point attractors only  there is no repeatable cyclic behaviour  although they introduced the concept of loose cyclic attractors  kanada        has shown that some one dimensional ca models that generate non chaotic patterns when updated synchronously generate edge of chaos patterns when randomised  orponen        has demonstrated that any synchronously updated network of threshold logic units  see artificial neuron  can be simulated by a network that has no constraints on the order of updates  sipper et al         investigated the evolution of non uniform cas that perform specific computing tasks  these models relax the normal requirement of all nodes having the same update rule  in their models  nodes were organised into blocks  nodes within a block were updated synchronously  but blocks were updated asynchronously  they experimented with three schemes      at each time step  a block is chosen at random with replacement      at each time step  a block is chosen at random without replacement      at each time step  a block is chosen according to a fixed update order 

there are different types of asynchronous updating  and different authors have described these in different ways  the schemes shown in the images below are as follows  cornforth et al        

the synchronous scheme   all cells are updated in parallel at each time step  this is the conventional model  stated here for comparison 
the random independent scheme   at each time step  a cell is chosen at random with replacement  and updated 
the random order scheme   at each time step  all nodes are updated  but in random order 
the cyclic scheme   at each time step a node is chosen according to a fixed update order  which was decided at random during initialisation of the model 
the self clocked scheme   each cell has an independent timer  initialised to a random period and phase  when the period has expired  the cell is updated and the timer reset  updating is autonomous and proceeds at different rates for different cells 
the self sync scheme   the same as the clocked scheme  but the phase of the timers are affected by local coupling to neighbours  and so are able to achieve local synchrony 
the time state diagrams below show the differences that are caused by changing the update scheme of the cellular automata model without changing any other parameters  the rule used  rule     is the same for each diagram

implications
often  models like cellular automata are used to help understanding of processes that work in real life  by building simplified models  new insights can be learned  there is always a question of how simple these models should be in order to adequately describe what is being modelled  the use of asynchronous models can allow an extra level of realism in the model  all of the schemes described above have their part in real life  the random independent scheme could be appropriate for modelling social networks or communication in computer networks  the clocked scheme could be appropriate for modelling insect colonies  while the self synchronous scheme could be applied to neural tissue
